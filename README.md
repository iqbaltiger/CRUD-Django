Welcome to the CRUD-Django wiki
This project is developed for a Todo management. And this is based on Django2.2

Here i did:

 1. Create a Todo
 2. View all Todo as a list 
 2. Update a Todo
 3. Delete a Todo
All those aforementioned functionalities were developed by using the Django framework based coding principle.
